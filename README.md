# Todo App

I have implemented the add project, add task to project, drag and drop order priority and dropdown task loader.
You can install the project with the following steps:
  - Be in the project folder
  - Check for requirements in composer.json file
  - Must have php 7.3 or later
  - Run: composer install
  - Run: npm install
  - Run: npm run dev
  - Copy .env.example file to .env and then, edit the database config like: 
        - DB_DATABASE=DB_NAME
        - DB_USERNAME=USERNAME
        - DB_PASSWORD=YOUR_PASSWORD
  - Run: php artisan migrate
